Summary:
- This portfolio was done for a former colleague of mine. Paul is trying to get into the data science world and asked for my help in preparing a portfolio of the work he has done so far.
- I met with Paul on a few occassions to gather some information about what he was looking for. 
- I stayed in touch with Paul over the course of the time I was working on this, up until the final product was delivered to him.
