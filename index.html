          <h2>About Me</h2>
  
          <img id="bacon" src="Sauchelli.jpeg" alt="Paul Pic">
      
          <p> My name is Paul Sauchelli. I am a New Jersey native who has lived in Colorado since 2013. I love to ski, hike, and camp. I am also an avid video gamer,and I play a lot of Kerbal Space Program, Rocket League, and Total War games (among many others). I graduated from St. Mary's College of Maryland with a B.A. in Economics. I always enjoyed doing advanced statistical analyses on data sets to learn about the world and further my education. After college, I got involved in a series of sales postions at a variety of companies. I have worked in finance, telecom, foundation repair and engineering, exterior home remodeling, and security alarm systems. In 2019, I started playing around with programming in Python, and quickly became engrossed in both the challenging puzzles presented by coding and the incredible power of data analysis made available to me. It was shortly therafter that I committed myself to a career change, and today I am working diligently, afrer work and on weekends, to continue learning and expanding my skill set. The thing that compels me so much is that what many in the industry would consider work, I consider fun. Resolving technical challenges and manipulating data sets, and the kernal of insight that comes at the end, simply makes me happy.
          </p>
  
          <p> That being said, while my mind is always open to career options, I feel that my greatest value is as a Business Intelligence analyst. I simply have so much business experience that I would have an easier time extracting actionable insight for a business. I can look at the numbers and see the people behind them, and really understand how the data and my reports can make their lives better and make the business stronger.
          </p>
  
          <p> If you feel that an experienced businessman who genuinely enjoys technical challenges is the right kind of person for your organization, please reach out to me. I'd love to speak to you and learn more!
